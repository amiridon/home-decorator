# Week 1 Completion: Mobile Test-Harness for Home Decorator

This document outlines the deliverables completed for Week 1 of the Home Decorator project implementation timeline.

## Implemented Features

### 1. .NET MAUI Shell

- Created a structured Shell-based navigation system with four main tabs:
  - Home
  - Design History
  - Billing
  - Settings
- Set up proper navigation between pages using Shell routing

### 2. Fake-Data Toggle

- Added a `IsFakeDataMode` flag to the `IFeatureFlagService`
- Implemented a toggle switch in the Settings page
- Set up visual indicators when fake data mode is enabled
- Created a user-friendly interface to control this testing feature

### 3. DI Plumbing

- Registered all core services in MauiProgram.cs
- Added mock implementation of services for development:
  - `MockBillingService`
  - `MockGenerationService`
  - `MockProductMatcherService`
  - `MockRecommendationService`
- Set up dependency injection for all views

## Testing the Mobile Harness

To test the MAUI app:

1. Run the application in your preferred emulator/simulator
2. Navigate through the tabs to ensure the shell navigation works correctly
3. Go to Settings and toggle the Fake Data Mode
4. Try creating a new design by clicking the "Start New Design" button
5. Observe the fake data mode indicator showing when enabled

## Next Steps (Week 2)
