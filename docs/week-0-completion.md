## Summary of Completed Tasks

### 1. Repository Structure
- ✅ Created core solution structure with necessary projects:
  - `HomeDecorator.Api`: Minimal .NET API for backend services

  - `HomeDecorator.Infrastructure`: Implementation of data access and external services
  - `HomeDecorator.MauiApp`: Mobile application shell for iOS and Android
  - `HomeDecorator.UnitTests`: Unit test project
  - `HomeDecorator.IntegrationTests`: Integration test project

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Set up GitHub workflow for CI/CD in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- ✅ Added secret scanning with TruffleHog in `.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml`
- ✅ Added automated secret rotation check workflow in `.github/workflows/secret-rotation-check.yml`

### 3. Secret Management
- ✅ Implemented user secrets with `dotnet user-secrets init` for the API project
- ✅ Configured Azure Key Vault integration preparation (code is ready but disabled in dev mode)
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive files
- ✅ Created pre-commit hook in `init-repository.ps1` to check for potential secrets
- ✅ Created `SECURITY.md` with the security policy

### 4. Core Services

  - `IBillingService`: For Stripe integration and credit management
  - `IGenerationService`: For DALL·E API integration and image generation
  - `IProductMatcherService`: For matching products to images
  - `IRecommendationService`: For ranking and filtering product recommendations

### 5. API Surface
- ✅ Set up minimal API endpoints as per section 6 of the specification
- ✅ Added authentication and authorization placeholders
- ✅ All endpoints return 501 Not Implemented (to be filled in during later weeks)

### 6. Documentation
- ✅ Enhanced README.md with detailed project information
- ✅ Created this completion report to track progress

## Next Steps - Week 1

The next phase will focus on the Mobile Test-Harness:
- Implement .NET MAUI shell app
- Create fake-data toggle functionality
- Set up dependency injection plumbing

## Known Issues

1. MAUI project was showing namespace conflicts with 'MauiApp' - fixed by using fully qualified names
2. Build script needs refinement for full CI/CD pipeline
