# Stripe Integration Summary

## Overview
We've successfully integrated Stripe payment processing into the Home Decorator application. This document provides a summary of the integration and how to use it.

## Components Implemented

### 1. API Services
- `StripeService` - Handles communication with Stripe API for checkout and billing portal URLs
- `SqliteCreditLedgerService` - Manages credit transactions and balances in a SQLite database
- `MockBillingService` - Provides a test implementation for development

### 2. API Endpoints
- `/api/billing/checkout/{packId}` - Get a checkout URL for purchasing credits
- `/api/billing/portal` - Get a URL for the Stripe billing portal
- `/api/stripe/webhook` - Webhook endpoint for Stripe events
- `/api/billing/credits` - Get user's current credit balance
- `/api/billing/transactions` - Get user's transaction history

### 3. User Secret Configuration
Your Stripe keys have been successfully stored in user secrets:
- `Stripe:SecretKey`
- `Stripe:PublishableKey` 
- `DallE:ApiKey` (for next week's implementation)

## Using Stripe in the Application

### Development Mode
For development and testing, you can use the application in one of two modes:

1. **Fake Data Mode** (toggle in `appsettings.json`):
   ```json
   "FeatureFlags": {
     "IsFakeDataMode": true
   }
   ```
   This will use `MockBillingService` which simulates credit purchases without actual Stripe calls.

2. **Stripe Sandbox Mode**:
   ```json
   "FeatureFlags": {
     "IsFakeDataMode": false
   }
   ```
   This will use your Stripe sandbox account for real transactions using test cards.

### Credit Packs
The application offers the following credit packs:
- Starter Pack: 50 credits for $4.99
- Standard Pack: 200 credits for $14.99
- Premium Pack: 500 credits for $29.99
- Professional Pack: 1200 credits for $59.99

### Testing Stripe Integration

To test the Stripe integration:

1. Set `IsFakeDataMode` to `false` in `appsettings.json`
2. Run the API project: `dotnet run --project src/HomeDecorator.Api`
3. Use the endpoints in your MAUI app or with a tool like Postman

### Webhook Testing

For local webhook testing, you can use the Stripe CLI:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5002/api/stripe/webhook
```

This will forward Stripe events to your local webhook endpoint.

## Next Steps

For Week 3 implementation:
1. Implement DALLÂ·E API integration for image generation using the DallE:ApiKey already stored in user secrets
2. Create product matching services
3. Implement design history tracking
